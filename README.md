## Third Person Shooter
This is the repo for a Third Person Shooter game I have been developing to practice my skills.
## Things I will try to implement

* Advanced Character Locomotion
* 360Â° Strafing
* Aim Offset
* Implement different type of weapons
* Enemy AI
* UI Elements like Ammo , Player Health , Glowing
* Sound (footprints,weapon shot)


## Assets I have been using
* [Character from Unreal Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/paragon-lt-belica)
* [Weapon](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/89d86599a98045c5806d6fccd7c7071a)
* [VFX Pack](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/item/38a3355872ef41bab5d2ba5b21c29eba)

## Things I have added till now
